## Basic Functionality: 

<p>A Pomodoro Timer that implements a timer that alternates between focus and rest periods. Users can increase/decrease the focus and rest periods, and an alarm sounds off when the timer runs out.</p>
<p>The initial screen lets the user set the length of the focus and break and break sessions.</p>
<p>The "stop" button is disabled on the initial screen because the user has not yet started the timer.</p>
<p>When the user clicks the "play" button, the timer will always start a new focus session.</p>

<p>After the user clicks the "play" button, the buttons to change the focus and break duration are disabled, and the session timer appears.</p>
<p>The session timer shows the type of session, either "Focusing" or "On Break", the total duration of the session, the time remaining, and a progress bar showing how much of the session is complete.</p>

<p>If the user clicks the "pause" button, "paused" appears below the time remaining.</p>
<p>The session timer shows the type of session, either "Focusing" or "On Break", the total duration of the session, the time remaining, and a progress bar showing how much of the session is complete.</p>
